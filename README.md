# Lab 5 Description

Lab 5 refactors the Environment class to be a singleton, and provides it with a way to add, store, and remove weapons, as well as finding the distance between cells and lifeforms within those cells.

# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: Yes, so long as everyone is trying hard to accomplish the parts they are capable of.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Answer: To check in and make sure everyone is on the correct time table.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

Answer: twice a week over discord.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Answer: Divide according to UML and workflow outlined in the assigned lab. Each person will get roughly equal amounts of work and assignments will be discussed in a meeting.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Answer: We are aware of the difference in ability among the team
members. While picking the tasks (according to the answer for the above
question), some member can consider take less work. As long as everybody keeps
positive and constant communication with the whole team, changes can be
adopted. However, if a member cannot make the deadline and does not communicate
with the team, a majority vote can be held to determine whether and how much
partial grade the member should receive for the particular lab in progress. For
example, this member may only receive 75% of the grades the team get for this
lab.

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Answer: Using a Discord group listing deadlines and responsibilities, transcribed into the following table.
